# go-todo-console-app
This project is a simple console-based To-Do list application built in Go (Golang). It allows users to manage tasks by adding, viewing, and removing them. This is an excellent mini project for learning the basics of Golang, including slices, functions, and control structures.

## Features

- **Add tasks** to your list.
- **View all tasks** in the list.
- **Remove tasks** by specifying the task index.
- Basic **error handling** for user inputs.

## Requirements

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) 1.18 or later installed.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AymanJanati/go-todo-console-app.git
   cd go-todo-console-app
2. Run the application:
    ```bash
    go run main.go

Once you run the application, you'll be prompted with a menu where you can:

    1: Add a task to the list.
    2: View all tasks.
    3: Remove a task by its index.
    4: Exit the application.
